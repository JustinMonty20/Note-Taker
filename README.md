# Note-Taker


AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

1. User will load up the app and click on the get started button.  
2. It will take them to the note.html page and allow them to type in a title for a note and some text to describe it. 
3. When they click on the save button icon it will save that note and display it onto the left side of the webpage. 
4. If the user clicks on a note to the left side of the page the note text will populate the two main inputs again. 
5. When the user clicks on the trash can it will delete the note from the left hand side of the page as well as the database.
